Termed Ecological Collective Flourishing (E-Co-Flourishing), the approach integrates physical, emotional, social, and ecological dimensions of wellbeing. The research aims to understand and harness the mechanisms by which engagement with green spaces and cultural institutions can support mental health, particularly in non-clinical settings. By developing and testing scalable, evidence-based programmes, the Theme seeks to contribute to a new model of preventative mental healthcare rooted in community and environmental engagement."

      "content": "The research is led from Oxford, including its Gardens, Libraries and Museums (GLAM), in collaboration with Blackpool research initiatives and the Universities of Birmingham and Reading. These diverse settings serve as “Living Laboratories” where real-world interventions can be tested and refined. The inclusion of both urban and rural environments ensures that findings are applicable across a range of social and ecological contexts. The collaboration brings together expertise from mental health science, environmental studies, plant sciences, humanities, and economics, and is supported by partnerships with community organisations, charities, and public institutions.\n\nAnother paragraph."
