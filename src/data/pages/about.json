Termed Ecological Collective Flourishing (E-Co-Flourishing), the approach integrates physical, emotional, social, and ecological dimensions of wellbeing. The research aims to understand and harness the mechanisms by which engagement with green spaces and cultural institutions can support mental health, particularly in non-clinical settings. By developing and testing scalable, evidence-based programmes, the Theme seeks to contribute to a new model of preventative mental healthcare rooted in community and environmental engagement."
