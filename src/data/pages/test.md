      This Theme is dedicated to advancing the science of mental health and
      wellbeing through the development of innovative, nature-based
      interventions that promote both human and planetary flourishing.
      Termed Ecological Collective Flourishing (E-Co-Flourishing), the approach
      integrates physical, emotional, social, and ecological dimensions of
      wellbeing. The research aims to understand and harness the mechanisms by
      which engagement with green spaces and cultural institutions can support
      mental health, particularly in non-clinical settings. By developing and
      testing scalable, evidence-based programmes, the Theme seeks to contribute
      to a new model of preventative mental healthcare rooted in community and
      environmental engagement.
